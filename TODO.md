# TODO

The single ordered backlog. `CLAUDE.md` explains *why* things are the way they
are, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` records what was decided when; this file is only
what is left to do.

Last updated 2026-08-14: **SPEC-ACCOUNTS phase 2 is built and harness-proven**
— machines, drives, the per-machine signalling Durable Object, the connect
ceremony, the file protocol, and the `/share` + `/machines` pages. The spec
grew §13 and §12 K–S; the harness is at **263**. Done items below are kept as
one-liners because their numbers are cross-referenced from `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

---

## Do this first

### 1. ~~Close the harness's three coverage gaps~~ — done 2026-08-13

Harness snags, still true when running it: kill stray `wrangler dev` first (a
second instance silently takes 8788); delete `dist/_redirects` or run
`npm run predeploy`, never bare `npm run build`, before `dev:worker`; the
last-operator guard check skips if a non-`harness-` operator exists in local D1.

### 2. ~~Redeem one recovery code on the live site~~ — done 2026-08-14

Driven in a real Chromium against production with a throwaway account
(`fable-check` — non-operator, left in D1; remove via `/admin` if unwanted)
so the operator's own ten codes are untouched: signup → codes shown once →
sign out → redeem code → set-password ticket → signed in, `9 of 10` left →
sign out → sign in again with the new password. `wrangler tail` ran through
the whole browse: zero CSP reports.

### 2b. ~~App-shell/UI review~~ — done 2026-08-13 (eight findings fixed)

### 2c. By eye, in a real browser (needs the client)

Everything listed under *Unverified by eye* at the bottom.

### 2d. The HUD pass — built 2026-08-14, two things need the client

The layout upgrade and the three presets are in and the build is clean;
`docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-14 has the full note. Two items were decided *for*
the client and are one line each to reverse:

- **The contact sheet keeps its palette duotone in calm, at 10%.** `calm` does
  not strip `mix-blend-mode`, so this was a decision either way. Reasoning: calm
  exists for body-copy legibility and a photograph is not body copy. If the
  client wants calm to be tint-free, it is `opacity: 0` on
  `.is-calm.layout-sheet .v-tile.has-img::after` in `layouts.css`.
- **Presets are operator-only**, because every appearance control in the command
  palette already is, and `.v-paste` lives in the operator-only panel. The
  proposal described them as something a visitor could pick; making that true is
  a product decision about who controls the site's look, so it was not taken.

~~**Cannot be verified from this side**: the canvas effects.~~ **Done
2026-08-14.** All sixteen were rendered and looked at, at two viewport sizes and
two palettes, plus `hud`+`scan`, `hud`+`telemetry` and `terminal`+`rain` on the
real site. Circles are round; `plasma`'s grid arrives at ~58 columns across 1526
CSS pixels, so the per-frame `setTransform` is handing effects CSS pixels and not
device pixels. `scan` and `telemetry` read as intended.

Two things worth knowing for the next person who tries: nothing is visible unless
the tab is visible **and** calm is off. The verification browser reports both
`document.hidden` *and* `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and calm hides the
canvas — that second half is why this looked unverifiable twice.

It found one real bug, in the default effect: `vessels` never rebuilt its tree on
a resize, so after a window resize the trunk sat off-centre and the side branches
floated detached in mid-page. A regression from the buffer change (before it,
`w`/`h` were constant). Fixed — `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-14 has the reasoning.

## Accounts

### 3. ~~Operator password reset~~ — done 2026-08-13
### 4. ~~TOTP enrolment screen~~ — done 2026-08-13
### 5. ~~Passkeys, saved setups, dialog primitive, command palette~~ — done 2026-08-13

`⌘K` stays unbound (claimed twice — sign-off list); the palette opens by
typing `cmd`.

### 5b. Phase 2 — ~~plumbing and interface~~ — built 2026-08-14

Spec §13 and §12 K–S; migration `0004`; `worker/machines.ts` + the
`MachineSignal` DO; `src/share/*`; `/share` and `/machines` pages (typed
routes `share` / `machines`, linked from the `/signin` summary). Harness
drives every route, the ceremony crypto, and the path validator — the WebRTC
hop itself needs two real Chromium tabs, which is the client's walk-through.
Remaining inside phase 2:

- ~~**Grid and Column explorer modes**~~ — done 2026-08-14 (view switcher
  remembered per drive under `vessel.explorer.v1`, palette-drawn SVG file-type
  icons, Miller columns with cached panes, §10 progress wash, sortable List
  headers; calm collapses to List). Still inside §10 and deliberately
  deferred: **image thumbnails from actual bytes** — reading whole files over
  the channel to decorate a grid wants the phase-3 read-cap conversation
  first, so tiles use the drawn icons for now.
- **TURN** — mechanics specified (§12 P), enablement is a client spend
  decision; without it a hard-NAT pair fails with an honest message.
- **The Pi sharing host** (`docs/pi-sharing-host.md`) can now point its final
  step at `/share`.

### 6. ~~Lightsword duel rebuild~~ — ornament home done 2026-08-13

- **6b. Un-hide the background `FX` entries once the client passes the
  ornament's motion.** Since 2026-08-14 they are *in* `FX` at indices 12 and 13
  carrying `hidden: true`, so this is now deleting two flags rather than an
  append — the HUD pass needed those indices reserved concretely, not by
  comment, before appending `scan` and `telemetry` at 14/15. The 404 copy note
  that used to travel with this was wrong: no "12 background modes" string
  exists in `pages.ts`. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-14.

### 7. Sound — asked for twice, not built. A spec change (control, persisted
toggle, share-code field), not a patch.

---

## Content and copy

### 8. Edit mode — operator-editable copy/images. Large; blocked on the images
spec change (R2 or similar).
### 9. A setup guide page/download (Tailscale et al.) — asked for 2026-08-12.
### 10. Photo slots hold Wikimedia placeholders (`docs/PHOTOS.md`); swap for
the operator's own when they exist, same treatment (EXIF stripped, lazy,
desaturated).

---

## Polish

### 11. Richer transitions/slide-overs/typewriter — after accounts; confirm
the motion-primitives approach before building.
### 12. ~~CSP~~ — nonce plumbed and shipped **report-only** 2026-08-14
(`cspPolicy` in `worker/index.ts`; reports to `/api/csp-report`, logged in
`wrangler tail`, stored nowhere). Remaining half: **flip to enforcing** — one
header rename in `harden` — after production runs quiet through the surfaces
the harness cannot drive: a passkey ceremony, a phase-2 browse over the
signalling socket, TOTP enrolment, each canvas effect. Harness 260 → 263.
### 13. Cloudflare "Always Use HTTPS" — dashboard toggle, belt and braces.

---

## Security — found, reviewed, deliberately open

### 14. Password change is not a session-revocation event. Bounded by the
30-minute TTL / 12-hour ceiling; closing it needs a session table (design
change, not a patch).
### 15. ~~`/api/account/slot` authorises on the session alone~~ — password-proof
gate done 2026-08-14 (`assertPassword`, rate-limited; harness 258 → 260). The
TOTP half deliberately did **not** land there: the slot bytes are identical
whatever the caller intends, so a code requirement on that endpoint cannot
tell §12 K's password-only connect from §3's sign gesture — an attacker would
claim the weaker purpose. **The fresh-TOTP check moves to the phase-3
grant-submission endpoint**, which sees the signed grant itself; build it
before anything accepts a real grant. `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-14.
### 16. DNS hardening, in the dashboards (2026-08-13 audit; records in
`docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md`): enable DNSSEC + DS at Namespro; add CAA; DMARC
`p=none` → observe two weeks → `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`.

---

## Unverified / unresolved

- **All of phase 2 by eye**: pairing, drive picking, the agent tab's states,
  a real two-tab WebRTC browse and download, offline/re-attach/take-over
  flows, the `/machines` explorer — now including the Grid and Column modes,
  the icons, the wash, and the column slide (2026-08-14, unseen). The harness proves every route and the
  ceremony's bytes; it cannot run `RTCPeerConnection`.
- **Matrix rain fall speed** — rebuilt, never confirmed by eye.
- **Several palettes fail WCAG AA** — deliberate; calm mode is the remedy.
- **Animation cannot be verified from screenshots here** — occluded windows
  freeze rAF; motion needs the client's eye.

---

## Awaiting client sign-off

Found while building; none blocking. Reasoning in `CLAUDE.md` unless noted.

1. **`totp.last_step`** — a field §9's inventory does not list. Without it a
   TOTP code replays for up to 90s. **Recommend approving.**
2. **§3's operator row is stronger than the design supports** — the wording,
   not the cryptography.
3. **`⌘K` is claimed twice** — door (SPEC.md) vs command palette
   (SPEC-ACCOUNTS §10).
4. **Signup discloses handle availability (409)** while `challenge` hides it.
5. **TURN**: enable Cloudflare TURN (per-byte spend, short-lived credentials
   already specified) or leave hard-NAT pairs with the honest failure (§12 P).
6. **Contact-page email** (`src/data/mail.ts`): the site assembles
   `patrickmcclevarty@outlook.com` (verbatim from the spec) but the address on
   file is `…@hotmail.ca`. Contact is the one page with a job — confirm the
   mailbox is real and read. (Carried from the 2026-08-13 full review.)
7. **Per-account subdomains: wanted at all?** If yes, an Origin allowlist must
   land first (`design/GUIDE-SUBDOMAINS.md`); if no, the guide can be closed.
8. **When to retire the Pages project** — it is the rollback; retiring it
   deletes the `_redirects` trap class.
9. **Free-diagnostic copy rewrite** — client leaning yes; wording and any fee
   pending.

**Starting a session?** `docs/HANDOFF.md` has a paste-ready prompt, the deploy
verification block, and the list of things that cannot be verified from this side.
